# Cryptocurrency Threshold Evaluator

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Requirements
* Node.js
* npm

## Dependencies
* [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/) for time and date handling

## Running the App
1. Clone the repo or download

2. Enter the App folder and run ```npm install``` in the terminal.

3. To run the App use ```npm start```.

## Styles
CSS styles in the App.css file. 
I have used [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/) methodology to structure the CSS and reduce its footprint.
